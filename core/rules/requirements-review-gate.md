# Requirements Review Gate

Before writing `requirements.md`, review the draft requirements and repair local issues until the draft passes or a true scope ambiguity is discovered.

## Scope and Coverage Review

- The draft must cover the feature's core user journeys, major scope boundaries, primary error cases, and meaningful edge conditions that are visible to the user or operator.
- Business/domain rules, compliance constraints, security/privacy expectations, and operational constraints that materially shape user-visible behavior must be reflected explicitly when they are in scope.
- If coverage is missing because the draft is incomplete, repair the draft and review again.
- If coverage cannot be completed cleanly because the project description or steering context is ambiguous, contradictory, or underspecified, stop and ask the user to clarify instead of guessing.

## EARS and Testability Review

- Every acceptance criterion must follow the EARS rules defined in `ears-format.md`.
- Every requirement must be testable, observable, and specific enough that later design and validation can verify it.
- Remove implementation details that belong in `design.md` rather than `requirements.md`.
- Requirement headings must use stable canonical IDs. Preserve IDs from the source specification; when creating new IDs, follow one repository convention consistently and never renumber existing requirements merely to fit this template.

## Structure and Quality Review

- Group related behaviors into coherent requirement areas without duplicating the same obligation across multiple sections.
- Make inclusion/exclusion boundaries explicit when the feature scope could otherwise be misread.
- Ensure non-functional expectations remain user-observable or operator-observable; move technology choices and internal architecture detail out of requirements.
- Normalize vague language such as "fast", "robust", or "secure" into concrete user-visible expectations whenever the source material supports it.

## Mechanical Checks

Before applying judgment, verify these mechanically:
- **Stable IDs present**: Every requirement heading has a unique canonical ID and the same ID appears in source traceability. Numeric (`1.1`) and domain (`LOT-U1`) forms are both valid when they match the repository convention.
- **Acceptance criteria exist**: Every requirement has at least one EARS-format acceptance criterion. Scan for requirements with no "When/If/While/Where" acceptance statements.
- **No implementation language**: Scan for technology-specific terms (database names, framework names, API patterns) that belong in design, not requirements. Flag any found.

## Review Loop

- Run mechanical checks first, then judgment-based review.
- If issues are local to the draft, repair the draft and re-run the review gate.
- Keep the loop bounded: no more than 2 review-and-repair passes before escalating a real ambiguity back to the user.
- Write `requirements.md` only after the review gate passes.
