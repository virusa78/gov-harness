# Task Generation Rules

## Core Principles

### 1. Natural Language Descriptions
Focus on capabilities and outcomes, not code structure.

**Describe**:
- What functionality to achieve
- Business logic and behavior
- Features and capabilities
- Domain language and concepts
- Data relationships and workflows

**Avoid in task titles and outcome descriptions**:
- Using file paths and directory structure as a substitute for the capability
- Function/method names and signatures
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Class names and API contracts
- Specific data structures

**Rationale**: Implementation details are defined in design.md and tasks describe functional outcomes. Each task must still carry a separate `_Files:` scope copied from the reviewed File Structure Plan so the execution gate can constrain and verify writes.

### 2. Task Ordering Principle

**Order implies dependency**: Task N implicitly depends on all tasks before it. This is the primary dependency mechanism.

**Tasks must follow this phase order**:
1. **Foundation**: Environment setup, test infrastructure, shared utilities, database schema, configuration
2. **Core**: Primary feature implementation (parallel-capable tasks grouped here)
3. **Integration**: Wiring components together, cross-boundary connections
4. **Validation**: E2E tests, edge cases, regression checks

**Rationale**: Foundation work unblocks everything else. Placing setup tasks early prevents downstream blocking. Core tasks can often run in parallel because foundation is already complete.

### 3. Task Integration & Progression

**Every task must**:
- Build on previous outputs (no orphaned code)
- Connect to the overall system (no hanging features)
- Progress incrementally (no big jumps in complexity)
- Respect architecture boundaries defined in design.md (Architecture Pattern & Boundary Map)
- Honor interface contracts documented in design.md
- Use major task summaries sparingly—omit detail bullets if the work is fully captured by child tasks.

**End with integration tasks** to wire everything together.

### 4. Dependency Declaration

**Default**: Sequential ordering handles most dependencies (task N depends on tasks before it).

**Explicit declaration required when**:
- A task depends on a specific task in a different major-task group (cross-boundary)
- The dependency is non-obvious from ordering alone
- A task can skip ahead of its position (declared via `(P)`) but still needs specific prior work

**Format**: `_Depends: 1.2, 2.3_` — placed alongside `_Requirements:_` in task detail sections.

**Do not over-annotate**: If a task simply depends on the task directly before it, ordering alone is sufficient.

### 5. Boundary Scope

**Each task should declare its component boundary** using design.md component/module names:
- `_Boundary: AuthService_` or `_Boundary: API Layer, UserRepository_`
- Helps validate parallel safety: tasks with non-overlapping boundaries are parallel candidates
- Helps agents understand scope: what to touch and what not to touch

**When to use**: Required for tasks marked `(P)` to validate parallel safety. Omit for sequential tasks where scope is obvious from the description.

### 6. Flexible Task Sizing

**Guidelines**:
- **Major tasks**: As many sub-tasks as logically needed (group by cohesion)
- **Sub-tasks**: one coherent, independently verifiable outcome; use the repository's sizing convention rather than forcing a universal hour estimate
- Balance between too granular and too broad

**Don't force arbitrary numbers** - let logical grouping determine structure.

### 7. Requirements Mapping

**End each task detail section with**:
- `_Requirements: X.X, LOT-U1_` listing canonical requirement IDs exactly as written in requirements (comma-separated). Never translate or renumber them.
- `_Files: path/a, path/b_` listing expected create/modify scope from the reviewed design. This is scope metadata, not the task outcome.
- For cross-cutting requirements, list every relevant requirement ID. If an ID is missing, stop and correct requirements before generating tasks.
- Reference components/interfaces from design.md when helpful (e.g., `_Contracts: AuthService API`)

### 8. Code-Only Focus

**Include ONLY**:
- Coding tasks (implementation)
- Testing tasks (unit, integration, E2E)
- Technical setup tasks (infrastructure, configuration)

**Exclude**:
- Deployment tasks
- Documentation tasks
- User testing
- Marketing/business activities

## Task Plan Review Gate

Before writing `tasks.md`, review the draft task plan and repair local issues until the plan passes or a true spec gap is discovered.

### Coverage Review

- Every requirement ID from `requirements.md` must appear in at least one task.
- Every design component, interface/contract, integration point, runtime prerequisite, and validation concern from `design.md` must be represented by at least one task.
- If coverage is missing because the task plan is incomplete, repair the draft tasks and review again.
- If coverage cannot be added cleanly because requirements or design are ambiguous, contradictory, or underspecified, stop and return to the requirements/design phase instead of papering over the gap in `tasks.md`.

### Executability Review

- Every sub-task must be executable as written and produce one independently verifiable outcome.
- Every sub-task must produce a verifiable deliverable (behavior, artifact, endpoint, UI state, config, migration, test, or integration result).
- Split tasks that combine multiple independently verifiable outcomes.
- Merge or collapse tasks that are too small, bookkeeping-only, or not meaningful execution units.
- Make implicit prerequisites explicit as preceding tasks.
- Re-check `_Depends:_`, `_Boundary:_`, and `(P)` markers after edits so concurrency claims still match the design boundaries and dependency graph.

### Review Loop

- Run the review gate on the draft task plan before writing `tasks.md`.
- If issues are task-plan-local, repair the draft and re-run the review gate.
- Keep the loop bounded: no more than 2 review-and-repair passes before escalating a real spec gap.
- Write `tasks.md` only after the review gate passes.

### Optional Test Coverage Tasks

- When the design already guarantees functional coverage and rapid MVP delivery is prioritized, mark purely test-oriented follow-up work (e.g., baseline rendering/unit tests) as **optional** using the `- [ ]*` checkbox form.
- Only apply the optional marker when the sub-task directly references acceptance criteria from requirements.md in its detail bullets.
- Never mark implementation work or integration-critical verification as optional—reserve `*` for auxiliary/deferrable test coverage that can be revisited post-MVP.

## Task Hierarchy Rules

### Maximum 2 Levels
- **Level 1**: Major tasks (1, 2, 3, 4...)
- **Level 2**: Sub-tasks (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2...)
- **No deeper nesting** (no 1.1.1)
- If a major task would contain only a single actionable item, collapse the structure and promote the sub-task to the major level (e.g., replace `1.1` with `1.`).
- When a major task exists purely as a container, keep the checkbox description concise and avoid duplicating detailed bullets—reserve specifics for its sub-tasks.

### Sequential Numbering
- Major tasks MUST increment: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
- Sub-tasks reset per major task: 1.1, 1.2, then 2.1, 2.2...
- Never repeat major task numbers

### Parallel Analysis (default)
- Assume parallel analysis is enabled unless explicitly disabled (e.g. `--sequential` flag).
- `(P)` means: this task has no dependency on its immediately preceding peers and can run concurrently with them.
- Identify tasks that can run concurrently when **all** conditions hold:
  - No data dependency on other pending tasks
  - No shared file or resource contention
  - No prerequisite review/approval from another task
  - `_Boundary:_` annotations confirm non-overlapping component scopes
- Foundation-phase tasks (see Task Ordering Principle) are rarely `(P)` — they establish shared prerequisites.
- Core-phase tasks are the primary candidates for `(P)` since foundation is already complete.
- Validate that identified parallel tasks operate within separate boundaries defined in the Architecture Pattern & Boundary Map.
- Confirm API/event contracts from design.md do not overlap in ways that cause conflicts.
- `(P)` tasks with cross-boundary dependencies must declare `_Depends: X.X_` explicitly.
- Append `(P)` immediately after the task number for each parallel-capable task:
  - Example: `- [ ] 2.1 (P) Build background worker`
  - Apply to both major tasks and sub-tasks when appropriate.
- If sequential mode is requested, omit `(P)` markers entirely.
- Group parallel tasks logically (same parent when possible) and highlight any ordering caveats in detail bullets.
- Explicitly call out dependencies that prevent `(P)` even when tasks look similar.

### Checkbox Format

- [ ] 1. Foundation: environment and test infrastructure setup
- [ ] 1.1 Sub-task description
  - Detail item 1
  - Detail item 2

  - Detail items...
  - _Requirements: Y.Y_
  - _Boundary: AuthService_

- [ ] 2.2 (P) Sub-task description
  - Detail items...
  - _Requirements: Z.Z_

- [ ] 3. Integration and wiring
- [ ] 3.1 Sub-task description
  - Detail items...
  - _Depends: 2.1, 2.2_
  - _Requirements: W.W_
```

## Requirements Coverage

**Mandatory Check**:
- ALL requirements from requirements.md MUST be covered
- Cross-reference every requirement ID with task mappings
- If gaps found: Return to requirements or design phase
- No requirement should be left without corresponding tasks

Use canonical requirement IDs from the source and repository. Numeric and domain-prefixed forms are both accepted, but a task may not introduce a new alias for an existing requirement.

Document any intentionally deferred requirements with rationale.
